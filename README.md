XCRI-CAP Demonstrator project
=============================

XCRI-CAP Facebook Course Search App
-----------------------------------

This project contains the example code and components for the XCRI-CAP Facebook Course Search app.

This project developed an XCRI-CAP based Facebook course search app. An institution or course provider can brand/style the app and install it on their Facebook page. The app will retrieve standard XCRI-CAP 1.2 data from the XCRI aggregator. Students can then use the app to find/view courses and 'click through' to the institutions own website. The use of the XCRI-CAP standard enables the course search data to be kept synchronised with the live courses information on the institution's website.

You can try out the app and read some of it's history on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/XcriCourseSearchApp "XCRI-CAP Course Search app") or for more information on how to use the app see the [project wiki](https://github.com/igsl/XcriCourseSearchApp/wiki "XCRI Course Search app wiki").
